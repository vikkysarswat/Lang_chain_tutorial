## ⚠️ Important Notes

### API Keys
Most examples require an OpenAI API key. Get yours at: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

### Costs
- OpenAI API usage is not free
- Start with GPT-3.5-turbo (cheaper)
- Use caching to reduce costs
- Monitor your usage on OpenAI dashboard

### Alternatives
Can't afford OpenAI? Try:
- **HuggingFace Models**: Free open-source models
- **Ollama**: Run models locally
- **Anthropic Claude**: Alternative LLM provider
- **Google Gemini**: Competitive pricing

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Module not found" errors**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**"API key not found"**
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key-here'
```

**"Rate limit exceeded"**
- Add delays between API calls
- Implement caching
- Use smaller models

**"Out of memory"**
- Reduce chunk sizes
- Process documents in batches
- Use streaming for large outputs
